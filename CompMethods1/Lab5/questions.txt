 b.E. coli 0157:H7 EDL933
 c.Yes, 2
 d.5349
 e.Yes. Bacterial, Archaeal and Plant Plastid Code
 f.This record contains all the genreal information for the organism but specifies CDS and gene only for this specific gene sequence 
 g.FASTA formatted, meaning it starts with '>' and description on the 1st line, then sequence on second line stringed together, not segmented by 10 nucleotide paired groups
 h.No, still at NCBI but looking at protein sequence data
 i.
 
4d.Shows the first:last amino acid corresponding to that intron sequence. It will depicts boundaries between exon/intron which representes in results the length for each exon/intron
