PART II
1. What terms are indented under Fever?
	Fever of Unknown Origin [C23.888.119.344.345]		
	Sweating Sickness [C23.888.119.344.672]
2. How far back can you search with the MeSH term, "Recombinant DNA?" 
	1977
3. What ages are included by the term, "Child, Preschool"?
	2-5
4. What is the preferred MeSH term for "drooling"?
	Sialorrhea
5. What disease is associated with a deficiency of factor VIII?
	Blood coagulation


PART III
1. In the PAM 250 matrix, where can the highest scores for each amino acid be found? Why?
	Where there is a 0 value
2. Would this be true for any scoring matrix?
	No
3. What row and column combination gives the highest score? (Specify the score value.)
	F,F with a value of 9
4. What is the second highest score? (Specify the score value.)
	F,Y with a value of 7
5. Why are some scores for amino acid identities higher than others?
	Mutation probability from one amino acid to the other differs
6. Use the back button on the browser, and calculate a PAM 100 matrix. Are the two highest scoring matches the
same combination of row and column as in the PAM 250 matrix? (Discuss your findings with your partner.)
	No
7. What is the gap penalty?
	-9
8. Explain any differences in the gap penalties of the PAM 250 matrix versus the PAM 100 matrix.
	PAM 250 substitution matrix, scale = ln(2)/3 = 0.231049
	Expected score = -0.844, Entropy = 0.354 bits
	Lowest score = -8, Highest score = 17

	PAM 100 substitution matrix, scale = ln(2)/2 = 0.346574
	Expected score = -1.99, Entropy = 1.18 bits
	Lowest score = -9, Highest score = 12


PART IV
1. Does your file look like this?
	Yes	
2. Try out the first webserver version of lalign, that allows you to Find Internal Duplications. First, select "Program:PLALIGN: plot DNA:DNA" from the drop down box, and then just enter the sequence from above in both boxes and hit the "Align Sequences". What do you see now?
	A dotplot with a prominent diagonal line
3. Does your second plot look like this?
	Yes	
4. How many repeated sequences exist in sequence we were analyzing? You should see 4 duplicated sequences.
	4
5. Why do you think the second method (webserver) was more sensitive? Meaning, why were the duplications more evident?
	Different scoring matrix
6. Use the following two sequences (gene1 and gene2) and ask yourself, "How many indels can you identify in the dot matrix for the two sequences"? Does your output from dottup look like this?
	2


PART V
1. What is function of the Hexokinase protein?
	An enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP and a D-hexose to ADP and a D-hexose 6-phosphate.
2. Obtain the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexokinase A (HKA) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae B (HXKB) genes found at the nucleotide database at NCBI.
	Ok.
3. Get both the CDS sequences and the proteins for these genes (save them as four separate files, yeastHKA.prot.fasta, yeastHKB.prot.fasta, yeastHKA.DNA.fasta, yeastHKB.DNA.fasta), and first run dottup with HKA and HKB with the DNA (CDS) sequences, do you see much? Then run dottup with the HKA and HKB protein sequences, do you see something like this?
	No


PART VI
1.
	A). What is the identity between the two DNA sequences?
		77.3%
	B). What is the identity between these two proteins? (must do the alignment with the protein sequences)
		77.8% identity (94.0% similar)
2. What is the similarity between these two proteins? What is the difference between similarity and identity in the protein alignment?
	Similarity means how functionally similar the two proteins are, even with different 		
	amino acids at particular positions, while identity refers only to identical amino 
	acids at the same position. 
3. What was the default scoring matrix used in the protein sequence analysis?
	BL50 matrix (15:-5), open/ext: -12/-2
4. Try out the webserver version of lalign, and change the scoring matrix to BLOSUM80. Does it change the output, i.e. what residues were shown as similar in using BLOSUM50, but are no longer similar with BLOSUM80?
	Yes, 
5. Obtain the human hexokinase-1 isoform HKI (RefSeq) from NCBI. use lalign36 on Defiance to align this protein with both the A and B versions of hexokinase. Does the human version of this protein appear to be more related to A or B, or is HKI equally distant from the yeast genes?
	HKI/HKA: 34.4% identity (65.6% similar)
	HKI/HKB: 35.4% identity (63.7% similar) 
6. Something is a little different about the human HK1 protein compared to HKA and HKB of yeast. Do a dotplot between human HK1 and yeast HKA. Remember the default window size is 10 for dottup, you will have to play with this setting a little. Does your output look like this? What type of relation if found, which might not have been so obvious by running the lalign program, despite the lalign program providing more quantitative information about aligned residues?	
	
	How is this significant?
