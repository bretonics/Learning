2. Do the regions predicted to be hydrophobic by ProtScale match those regions found in structure?
	Yes	


PART III
2.
	A). View the PSSM in Stacked Bar View and Matrix. What is the difference between these two views?
        	Stacked bar shows a concensus sequence with columns showing the PSSM scores for each residue at each position and the displays the frequencies of amino acids per position. Matrix view shows the concensus in rows and puts the scores for each amino acid placed in that position on the row.

	B). What positions in the query, are aligned with a score of >10
		14
	C). What positions in the query, are aligned with a score of 1.
    		4,9,18
	D). Use the protein you have selected found on our local page, and find the Conserved Domains found in it at NCBI.
		RecA- PSSM-Id:	249635

		What amino acids are highly conserved in your protein with the PSSM?
			Phenylalanine and Methionine. Glycine and Lysine were also pretty conserved.

		What amino acids are not conserved in your protein compared with the PSSM?
			None, but Alanine in position 12 and Glycine in position 16 have really low (2) scores.


3. Answer the following questions about scoring Matrices:
    1. What does the 1 in PAM1 mean?
     	Estimates rate of substitution expected if 1% of amino acids changed   
    2. What does the 62 in BLOSUM62 mean?
        Blocks of sequences that are at least 62% identical
    3. Why do Leucine and Isoleucine get a BLOSUM62 score of 2, whereas leucine and aspartic acid get a score of -4?
        Biochemical similarity
    4. What is the difference between a gap open and a gap extension penalty?
	Gap open penalty is the score given for creating an opening in the sequence, which is usually more costly, while gap extension penalty is for each subsequent gap after the opening. The extension is less penalized to allow possibly better alignments.
